# Homework Week 02 - CSS Portfolio

## Description

I have created a personal resume page that has dynamic css elements that change when the screen is re-sized. focusable elements also change dynamically depending on their current state. 

The style is original - and meant to resemeble the homeowrk readme mock-up, though not precisely in this case.

I do not have any live applications (I hope to in the near future!), so instead I have included previous work in music, and links to a webpage I designed (Hawaii Classic Duo)

## User Story

AS A prospective employee in the field of web design
I WANT a webpage that dynamically and stylistically shows off my coidng skill
SO THAT I can have all my work in one place as a kind of online resume, and to demonstrate my competence and skill in html, css and responsive web design.
